React.js

Uses axios and Fontawesome modules



### Challenges and things learned!

- Improved my skills with React! Made use of useState, and useEffect to render and update components. 
- Learned to use async and await instead of fetch to make API calls.
- Used a .env file to hide API key. I would like to improve my backend knowledge and use it to hide an API key from public eyes.
- Used the date input in a form.
- Learned about Date and epoch time, and figured out how to convert it to a standard yyyy-mm-dd format.
