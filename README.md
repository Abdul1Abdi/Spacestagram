## Built with

React.js

Uses axios and Fontawesome modules



### Challenges and things learned!

- Improved my skills with React! Made use of useState, and useEffect to render and update components. 
- Learned to use async and await instead of fetch to make API calls.
- Used the date input in a form.
- Learned about Date and epoch time, and figured out how to convert it to a standard yyyy-mm-dd format.
- Would like to improve backend skills so I can hide my API keys server-side.
